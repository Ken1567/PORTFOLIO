					<h2>MANUEL KENNON A. GARROVILLO</h2>
					<p>I am a career shifter with a degree in Teacher Education. Currently, I am training under Stacktrek as a Full Time Bootcamper.
					I am honing my skills in programming, particularly in using programming languages, as well as front-end and back-end development.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
					<p>When I focus at a certain work, I can and will get it done as soon as possible.
					I have time-management and is not distracted easily. On the other hand, I get frustrated when something
					I worked on for a long time doesn't work and I usually need a lot of encouragement for me to be able to
					start and finish my work.</p>
